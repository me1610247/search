The request lifecycle in Laravel represents the sequence of
 steps and processes that occur from the initiation 
of an HTTP request to its final response. 
It involves multiple stages and components working together 
to handle the incoming request and generate an appropriate response.
 Here are the primary steps in the request lifecycle in Laravel:
1-Routing:
 The request begins with the routing mechanism.
- Laravel's router matches the incoming URL to the registered routes.
- It determines which controller method or closure should handle the request.
2-Middleware Processing:
Middleware is executed before reaching the actual handler (controller or closure).
- Middleware can modify the request, perform authentication, log requests, and more.
- Global middleware, route-specific middleware, and group middleware are executed.
3-Request Handling:
The matched controller method or closure executes to handle the request.
- It processes the request, interacts with models, performs necessary operations, and prepares data.
4- Response Generation:
 After the request handling, the response is prepared.
- The controller method returns a response or view.
- Views are rendered, data is formatted, and response content is generated.
5- Middleware for Response:
 After the response is generated, the response passes through middleware.
- Response middleware can modify the final response before it's sent back to the client.
6-Sending the Response:
The final response is sent back to the client (browser, API consumer, etc.).
- The client receives and processes the response.
